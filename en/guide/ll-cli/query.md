Use `ll-cli query` to search app meta info from remote repository and local cache:

```bash
ll-cli query <calculator>
```

Add `--force` to force search app info from remote repository:

```bash
ll-cli query <calculator> --force
```

This command returns the info of all apps whose `appid` (appid is the app's unique identifier) contains the keyword "calculator", including the complete `appid`, application name, version, CPU architecture and descriptions.

Here is the output:

```text
