# Build App

Use `ll-builder build` to build a Linglong application.

View the help information for the `ll-builder build` command:

```bash
ll-builder build --help
```

Here is the output:

```text
Usage: ll-builder [options] build

Options:
  -v, --verbose show detail log
  -h, --help Displays help on commandline options.
  --help-all Displays help including Qt specific options.
  --exec <exec> run exec than build script

Arguments:
  build build project
```

The `ll-builder build` command must be run in the root directory of the project, where the `linglong.yaml` file is located.

Taking the Linglong project `org.deepin.demo`, as an example, the main steps to build a Linglong application would be as follows:

Go to the `org.deepin.demo` project directory:

```bash
cd org.deepin.demo
```

Execute the `ll-builder build` command to start building:

```bash
ll-builder build
```

After the build is complete, the build content will be automatically committed to the local ostree cache. See `ll-builder export` for exporting build content.

Use the `--exec` parameter to enter the Linglong container before the build script is executed:

```bash
ll-builder build --exec /bin/bash
```

After entering the container, you can execute `shell` commands, such as `gdb`, `strace`, etc.
